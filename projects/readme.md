# List of project topics

BE UNIQUE. Your project has to be significantly different than anything you can directly find in a blog post, textbook or Kaggle. The purpose of the project is to encourage you to solve a practical problem that you are interested in, based on what we taught in the classroom. Thus you should

* Think of a problem of your own, gather your data and think about what kind of algorithm is the best fit for your problem and try different parameter/network structure. For example, how about you write a letter on a piece of paper, present it to your computer camera and recognize it in realtime using SVM or CNN? How can you make sure you can still recognize it if it is upside down?
* Find some real-world data and use machine learning to solve it. For example, [NYC OpenData](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us) has lots of data available. 
* Most importantly, try your best NOT to copy code and dataset from some website and just change few parameters. Your grade will not be high.
* List of suggested some project topics are listed below. You are free to choose a topic not listed here. However, make sure you don't simply copy the code and just change few parameters. Instead, look at them as an example of how to apply ML to various problem.

 * [ML and society: Fairness, privacy, explainability](./ML_and_society.pdf)
 * [Security and robustness](./Security_and_robustness.pdf)

* What do we expect?
 * You should always add references to any data/code/tables/figures/sentences you copied from somewhere.
 * You can train on additional data and test on real-world data that you collected yourself;
 * You can compare different models and report their success, what kind of datapoints are usually missed with what models etc;
 * If you cannot make improvements, tell us why it failed and what are the lessons learned.
 * Try not to use a very large model or something you don't fully understand (such as a transformer models for NLP). It would be difficult to train or explain what is your contribution.
